**1. Executive Summary**

This document presents a comprehensive blueprint for building a Digital
AI FP&A (Financial Planning & Analysis) function at Nuvini Group Limited
(NASDAQ: NVNI). The vision is ambitious yet achievable: create an
AI-powered system that can first augment, then progressively replicate,
the output of a human FP&A team --- operating 24/7 across all portfolio
companies simultaneously.

Nuvini's unique position as a Latin American B2B SaaS serial acquirer
with 7+ portfolio companies (Effecti, Leadlovers, Ipê Digital, OnClick,
Dataminer, Smart NX, and growing) creates both the need and the perfect
use case for this system. Every acquisition adds complexity to the FP&A
workload: new P&Ls to consolidate, new KPIs to track, new variance
analyses to perform, and new board reports to generate. A traditional
FP&A team scales linearly with headcount. An AI FP&A scales infinitely.

**1.1 The Vision**

The Digital AI FP&A is not a single tool but an orchestrated ecosystem
of specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific domain of FP&A
work. These agents communicate, share data, validate each other's
outputs, and produce the same deliverables a senior FP&A team would ---
but with 24/7 availability, zero fatigue, perfect consistency, and the
ability to process all portfolio companies in parallel.

**1.2 Three-Phase Approach**

- Phase 1 --- Augmentation (Months 1--4): AI assists the existing FP&A
  person, automating 60--70% of repetitive work. Output quality and
  consistency improve immediately. The human focuses on judgment,
  relationships, and exceptions.

- Phase 2 --- Co-Pilot (Months 5--8): AI handles 80--90% of FP&A
  deliverables end-to-end. The human shifts to a reviewer/approver role,
  intervening only for complex judgment calls, investor-facing
  communications, and strategic decisions.

- Phase 3 --- Autonomous Replication (Months 9--12+): AI operates
  independently for routine FP&A functions, producing all standard
  deliverables on schedule. A human "FP&A Director" oversees the system,
  handles exceptions, and manages stakeholder relationships. The system
  self-replicates to handle new acquisitions automatically.

**2. Current FP&A Output Inventory**

Based on comprehensive analysis of Nuvini's Google Drive documents, SEC
filings, board materials, M&A documentation, investor relations
materials, and operational workflows, here is the complete inventory of
files, reports, and deliverables that Nuvini's FP&A function produces or
supports:

Total estimated FP&A deliverables: 35+ distinct output types across 7
categories, produced for 7+ portfolio companies, involving multiple
stakeholders (board, investors, SEC, auditors, management).

**3. Digital AI FP&A Architecture**

The Digital AI FP&A is built as a multi-agent system where specialized
AI agents handle distinct FP&A domains. These agents operate under an
orchestration layer that coordinates workflows, manages data flow, and
ensures quality control.

**3.1 Agent Ecosystem Overview**

The system comprises 8 core agents plus an orchestrator:

**3.1.1 The Orchestrator Agent ("FPA Director")**

The brain of the system. Receives inputs (calendar triggers, data
updates, human requests), decomposes them into tasks, assigns to
specialized agents, collects outputs, performs quality checks, and
delivers final deliverables.

- Maintains the master FP&A calendar and deadline tracker

- Routes work to appropriate specialized agents

- Performs cross-agent validation (ensures consolidation matches
  subsidiary totals)

- Manages escalation to human oversight when confidence is low

- Tracks and logs all agent activities for audit trail

**3.1.2 Data Ingestion Agent ("Data Collector")**

- Connects to ERPs, accounting systems, and financial databases of each
  portfolio company

- Pulls raw financial data (trial balances, journal entries, subledgers)

- Standardizes chart of accounts across companies (different ERPs,
  different CoAs)

- Handles FX conversion (BRL → USD at appropriate rates: closing,
  average, historical)

- Validates data completeness and flags missing periods or anomalies

- Leverages existing Financial Data Extractor skill for PDF/Excel
  processing

**3.1.3 Consolidation Agent ("Consolidator")**

- Performs multi-entity financial consolidation per IFRS/US GAAP

- Handles intercompany elimination entries

- Manages goodwill calculations, contingent consideration adjustments,
  and purchase price allocation amortization

- Produces consolidated P&L, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement

- Maintains a consolidated trial balance with full audit trail

- Handles the complexity of Nuvini's Cayman Islands holding structure
  with Brazilian operating subsidiaries

**3.1.4 Analysis & Variance Agent ("Analyst")**

- Performs budget vs. actual variance analysis for each portfolio
  company and consolidated

- Identifies root causes of variances using historical patterns and
  operational data

- Calculates and tracks KPIs: ARR, MRR, churn, ARPU, Rule of 40, NRR,
  LTV/CAC

- Generates management commentary explaining financial performance in
  natural language

- Runs trend analysis and flags anomalies or emerging risks

- Leverages the AI Cost Reduction Analysis skill for portfolio
  optimization recommendations

**3.1.5 Forecasting Agent ("Forecaster")**

- Builds and maintains rolling 12-month forecasts for each portfolio
  company

- Uses historical data, seasonality patterns, and growth assumptions to
  generate projections

- Runs Monte Carlo simulations for probability-weighted scenarios

- Models acquisition impacts: pro-forma consolidation, synergies,
  integration costs

- Produces 13-week cash flow forecasts for treasury management

- Automatically re-forecasts when actuals deviate beyond thresholds

**3.1.6 Reporting Agent ("Report Builder")**

- Generates all formatted deliverables: Excel reports, PowerPoint decks,
  Word documents

- Uses existing M&A Board Presentation skill for investment committee
  decks

- Produces board-ready packages with charts, tables, and executive
  summaries

- Creates press release drafts with GAAP/non-GAAP reconciliation tables

- Formats DRE reports per Brazilian accounting standards

- Generates PDF packages for SEC filings (6-K supporting materials)

**3.1.7 Compliance Agent ("Compliance Officer")**

- Monitors NASDAQ listing requirements (bid price, filing deadlines,
  governance)

- Tracks SEC filing calendar and triggers preparation workflows

- Validates financial statements against US GAAP disclosure requirements

- Cross-references reported figures against prior filings for
  consistency

- Flags potential compliance issues and generates remediation checklists

**3.1.8 M&A Financial Agent ("Deal Analyst")**

- Extracts financial data from CIMs using the Financial Data Extractor
  skill

- Builds valuation models using Nuvini's 3.5x EBITDA base methodology
  with delta structures

- Generates investment memos with IRR, MOIC, and risk-adjusted return
  analysis

- Produces board-ready M&A presentations using the M&A Board
  Presentation skill

- Manages the deal pipeline data: sourcing through closing (BTIG,
  NewHarbour deals)

- Performs post-acquisition integration financial tracking

**3.1.9 Communication Agent ("IR Writer")**

- Drafts investor communications (email updates, PR drafts) in English
  and Portuguese

- Generates earnings release narratives from financial data

- Creates 1-on-1 meeting materials for investor conferences

- Produces FAQ documents for common investor questions

- Maintains consistent messaging across all communications

**4. How the Agents Work Together: Workflow Examples**

**4.1 Monthly Close Process (Parallel Execution)**

This is the most important recurring workflow. Today it takes an FP&A
person days to weeks. The AI system targets same-day completion.

**Day 1 (T+1 after month-end):** Data Collection

- Data Ingestion Agent pulls trial balances from all 7+ portfolio
  company ERPs simultaneously (parallel)

- Each company's data is standardized to Nuvini's unified chart of
  accounts

- FX rates are pulled from Central Bank of Brazil (PTAX) and applied

- Data completeness validation runs; any gaps flagged to the
  Orchestrator

**Day 1--2:** Consolidation & Analysis (parallel)

- Consolidation Agent produces consolidated financials while Analysis
  Agent begins subsidiary-level analysis

- Intercompany eliminations are applied automatically based on
  predefined rules

- Variance Agent calculates budget vs. actual for each company and
  consolidated

- KPI Agent computes all SaaS metrics across the portfolio

**Day 2--3:** Report Generation (parallel)

- Report Builder generates: management report package, KPI dashboards,
  board summary

- Communication Agent drafts management commentary and highlights

- Compliance Agent validates output against prior period and flags
  inconsistencies

- Orchestrator performs final cross-validation: sum of parts =
  consolidated total

**Day 3:** Review & Distribution

- Human FP&A Director reviews AI-generated package (initially detailed
  review, progressively lighter touch)

- Approved reports are distributed to stakeholders

- Any corrections are fed back as training data for continuous
  improvement

**4.2 New Acquisition Integration**

When Nuvini closes a new deal (e.g., MK Solutions), the system
self-replicates:

- M&A Financial Agent transfers deal model to the Orchestrator with Day
  1 financial baseline

- Data Ingestion Agent is configured with new company's ERP connection
  and chart of accounts mapping

- Consolidation Agent adds the new entity to the consolidation structure
  with purchase price allocation entries

- All other agents automatically extend their scope to include the new
  company

- First month-end for the new company is processed alongside existing
  portfolio --- zero incremental human effort

**4.3 Board Report Preparation**

Before each quarterly board meeting, the Orchestrator triggers a
comprehensive workflow:

- Analysis Agent produces quarterly performance summary with YoY and QoQ
  comparisons

- Forecasting Agent updates full-year outlook based on latest actuals

- M&A Agent compiles pipeline status and active deal summaries

- Report Builder generates the full board deck using the M&A Board
  Presentation skill templates

- Communication Agent adds CEO narrative sections

- Compliance Agent ensures all disclosable information is properly
  flagged

- Final deck is assembled, validated, and presented for human review

**7. The Scaling Math: Why This Works for Nuvini**

**7.1 Current FP&A Workload Analysis**

A single FP&A person managing Nuvini's current scope works approximately
170 hours/month. Here is the estimated time allocation:

  ---------------------- --------------- --------- -------------------

  ---------------------- --------------- --------- -------------------

**7.2 The Portfolio Multiplication Effect**

Every new acquisition multiplies the FP&A workload. With the current
approach, Nuvini would need to hire additional FP&A staff for every 3--4
portfolio companies added. With the AI FP&A system:

  --------------------- ------------------ ------------------ -------------
  **Portfolio Size**    **Traditional FP&A **AI FP&A System** **Cost
                        Team**                                Savings**

  --------------------- ---------------- ---------------- ----------------

**8. Claude Code Swarms: The Parallel Execution Engine**

The Claude Code Swarms feature is the critical enabler for the AI FP&A's
most powerful capability: parallel execution across all portfolio
companies simultaneously.

**8.1 What Swarms Enables**

- Simultaneous processing: 7+ portfolio companies analyzed in parallel,
  not sequentially

- Specialized agents: Different agents handle different aspects of the
  same deal or report simultaneously

- Cross-validation: Multiple agents review the same data independently
  and flag discrepancies

- Scale independence: Adding a new portfolio company doesn't increase
  processing time

**8.2 Swarm Architecture for FP&A**

A typical monthly close with Swarms would look like:

- Swarm Leader (Orchestrator): Decomposes monthly close into parallel
  tasks

- Worker 1: Effecti data extraction + analysis

- Worker 2: Leadlovers data extraction + analysis

- Worker 3: Ipê Digital data extraction + analysis

- Worker 4: OnClick data extraction + analysis

- Worker 5: Dataminer data extraction + analysis

- Worker 6: Smart NX data extraction + analysis

- Worker 7: MK Solutions data extraction + analysis

- Consolidation Worker: Waits for all subsidiary workers, then
  consolidates

- Validation Worker: Cross-checks consolidated vs. sum of subsidiaries

- Report Worker: Generates final package from validated data

All subsidiary workers run in parallel. What takes a human 5--10 days is
completed in hours.

**8.3 Swarms for M&A**

When analyzing a new deal, Swarms enables simultaneous deep-dive
analysis:

- Worker A: Financial statement extraction and normalization

- Worker B: Revenue quality analysis and customer concentration

- Worker C: Cost structure analysis and AI savings opportunity

- Worker D: Market research and competitive positioning

- Worker E: Legal/compliance red flag identification

- Worker F: Valuation model construction (3.5x EBITDA + deltas)

- Final Worker: Assembles investment memo from all worker outputs

**9. Risk Management & Quality Assurance**

**9.1 Data Quality Controls**

- Automated reconciliation: every data pull is reconciled against source
  system totals

- Historical trend validation: any metric deviating \>20% from
  historical pattern triggers a flag

- Cross-company consistency: same metric definitions applied uniformly
  across portfolio

- FX rate validation: automated check against Central Bank published
  rates

**9.2 Output Quality Framework**

Every AI-generated deliverable receives a confidence score:

  --------------- ----------- ------------------ ---------------------------
  **Confidence    **Score**   **Action**         **Examples**

                                                 content
  --------------- ----------- ------------------ ---------------------------

**9.3 Audit Trail**

- Every agent action is logged with timestamp, input data, output data,
  and confidence score

- All financial transformations are traceable from source to final
  report

- Human overrides and corrections are logged and used for system
  improvement

- Full version history maintained for every deliverable

**9.4 Human-in-the-Loop Governance**

- Phase 1: Human reviews 100% of outputs

- Phase 2: Human reviews flagged items + random 20% sample

- Phase 3: Human reviews red items + random 10% sample + all
  SEC/investor-facing content

- The human FP&A Director is always the final signatory on any
  externally distributed report

As Nuvini grows to 15+ portfolio companies through the ContaBILY
strategy and continued SaaS acquisitions:

  Year 4 (25+        \$850,000 (7 FTEs) \$220,000 (run   \$630,000

  ------------------ ------------------ ---------------- -----------------

The system pays for itself in Year 2 and generates increasing returns as
the portfolio grows. By Year 4, it avoids \$630,000+ in annual FP&A
costs while delivering faster, more consistent output.

**11. Self-Replication: How the AI FP&A Scales Infinitely**

**11.1 The Replication Mechanism**

The most powerful aspect of the AI FP&A is its ability to
"self-replicate" for new acquisitions. Here is how it works:

**Step 1 --- New Entity Detection:** When a deal closes and the
Orchestrator receives the signal, it creates a new entity profile
including the company name, ERP type, chart of accounts, currency, and
opening balance sheet from the deal model.

**Step 2 --- Data Connection:** The Data Ingestion Agent deploys a new
connection module for the target's ERP. For common Brazilian ERPs
(TOTVS, ContaAzul, Omie, Bling), pre-built connectors exist. For others,
a custom connector is built once.

**Step 3 --- CoA Mapping:** The AI maps the new company's chart of
accounts to Nuvini's standardized structure using pattern matching and
historical mappings. A human validates the mapping once.

**Step 4 --- Agent Extension:** Every agent in the system automatically
extends its scope. The Consolidation Agent adds a new entity. The
Analysis Agent adds new variance rules. The KPI Agent adds new metrics.
The Report Builder adds a new section.

**Step 5 --- First Close:** The new company participates in the very
next monthly close alongside all existing companies. Zero incremental
processing time.

**11.2 ContaBILY Synergy**

This architecture is directly synergistic with the ContaBILY AI-powered
accounting firm rollup strategy. As ContaBILY acquires accounting firms
(target: 66 by 2029), the same AI FP&A architecture can be deployed to:

- Consolidate financial reporting across all acquired accounting firms

- Standardize client-facing output quality across the portfolio

- Monitor operational metrics (utilization, billing rates, client
  retention) at scale

- Generate the investor reporting that will be needed for ContaBILY's
  own fundraising

- Provide the AI efficiency gains (80%+ operational cost reduction) that
  are central to ContaBILY's investment thesis

**12. Immediate Next Steps**

**12.1 Week 1--2: Discovery & Documentation**

- Conduct detailed interview with current FP&A person to document every
  process, template, and data source

- Map all portfolio company ERP systems and access requirements

- Inventory every spreadsheet, template, and report currently in use

- Document the current chart of accounts for each entity

**12.2 Week 3--4: Architecture & Setup**

- Set up centralized PostgreSQL database with entity schema

- Build first ERP data connector (start with the largest/most complex
  portfolio company)

- Create standardized chart of accounts mapping table

- Begin building the Data Ingestion Agent using Financial Data Extractor
  skill as foundation

**12.3 Month 2: First Automated Close**

- Run first automated data pull for one portfolio company

- Produce first AI-generated management report for that company

- Compare AI output vs. human output for quality benchmarking

- Iterate and expand to remaining portfolio companies

  ------------------------ --------------- --------------- --------------

**13. Conclusion**

The Digital AI FP&A represents a paradigm shift in how Nuvini manages
its financial operations. Rather than scaling FP&A headcount linearly
with portfolio growth, this system provides infinite scalability with
marginal cost near zero for each additional portfolio company.

The technology exists today. The skills are already partially built. The
architecture is proven. What remains is disciplined execution of the
implementation roadmap, starting with the highest-impact, lowest-risk
automation (data ingestion and consolidation) and progressively
expanding to the full agent ecosystem.

For a company like Nuvini --- whose growth strategy is predicated on
acquiring more companies --- this is not just a nice-to-have. It is a
strategic imperative. The question is not whether to build this, but how
fast you can deploy it. Every month of delay is another month of manual
FP&A work that compounds with each new acquisition.

The AI FP&A is Nuvini's unfair advantage: the ability to operate with
the financial rigor of a company 10x its size, at a fraction of the
cost, with 24/7 availability, and perfect consistency across every
portfolio company.
